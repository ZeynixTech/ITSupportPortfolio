## Key Skills Demonstrated
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment  
- EC2 instance management  
- Auto Scaling configuration for dynamic capacity  
- Elastic Load Balancing setup  
- DNS management with CNAME records  
- CloudWatch metrics monitoring  
- Infrastructure as Code concepts (configuration through AWS Console)  
- Troubleshooting and verification of cloud deployments

## Features
1. **Elastic Beanstalk Deployment**
   - Deployed WordPress site on AWS environment  
   - Configured minimum and maximum instance counts  

2. **Auto Scaling**
   - Setup triggers for scaling based on **RequestCount** metrics  
   - Configured scaling thresholds and increments  

3. **Load Balancing**
   - Configured Elastic Load Balancer for high availability  
   - Associated load balancer with public subnets  

4. **DNS Management**
   - Created CNAME record to map custom domain to deployed environment  

5. **Documentation and Verification**
   - Blog posts documenting assignment objectives and reflections
