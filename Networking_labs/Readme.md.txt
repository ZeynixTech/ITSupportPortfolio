## Features
1. **Switch and Router Configuration**
   - Basic switch management  
   - VLAN setup and inter-VLAN routing  
   - Static and default routing  

2. **Dynamic Routing**
   - OSPF configuration for multi-router networks  

3. **Network Security**
   - DHCP configuration  
   - ACL implementation to control traffic  

4. **Lab Evidence**
   - Screenshots for all labs and final lab tests  
   - Configuration files and Packet Tracer saved projects
